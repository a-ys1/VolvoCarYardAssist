# VolvoCarYardAssist

School project where a tablet application for Volvo was created. The purpose of the application is to reduce the workload for the operators at car yards. It can display different cars on a map across the car yard and calculate the shortest possible path that an operator must travel when moving the cars. A manager can add tasks to the operators within the application, telling them where a car is supposed to be placed within the car yard. Other features on the application is to set a card yard area, register vehicles and search tasks.

The repository is structured with a "YardAssist" and "Documents" folder in the top lever folder. The code and the application is within the "YardAssist" folder. In the "Documents" folder you find our documents as "Acceptance_testing", "Project_Backlog" and "Requirements". "Documents" also contains the folder "Meeting_summaries" where you can find some meeting summaries and the folder "Design" where we have our UML designs.

Building instructions is given in the "Accaptence_testing" document. Follow the steps under the section "Setting up the application". The "Acceptance_testing" document can be found in the Document folder.
